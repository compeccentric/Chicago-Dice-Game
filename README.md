# Chicago Dice Game
An exercise in programming with Vanilla JavaScript to recreate a dice game Chicago.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used.
The rules of the game are:
Roll the number of the round to win a point.
The game starts on round two as two dice are used in the game.
After each role it is the next player's turn to roll.
The one with the most points after 11 rounds wins!
